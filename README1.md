# 2. Project Description 
- ###   PROBLEM STATEMENT : TOURISM RECOMMENDATION ENGINE WITH LOCAL CULTURE FOCUS
 ##### * *Introduction*:  
 Culture and tourism together create a beautiful journey of the heart
 and mind. Culture is the soul of a place—its traditions, art, music,
 and way of life. Tourism lets us experience this beauty first and,
 offering more than just sightseeing. It's about feeling the rhythm of
 folk songs, tasting age-old recipes, walking through history, and
 connecting deeply with people and nature. It’s a return to
 simplicity—where stories are told through dances, values are
 passed down in festivals, and peace is found in the embrace of
 nature. In this journey, we don’t just learn—we feel, we grow, and
 we find a piece of ourselves
